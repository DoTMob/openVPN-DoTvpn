# openVPN-DoTvpn v1
EASY OpenVPN  R.W.I  for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS [VPS]


This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoTMob/openVPN-DoTvpn/master/openvpn-install.sh -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.

I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that
You can get a VPS from just $3/month at https://www.ovh.com/world/vps/  or   https://www.vultr.com  with anti-Ddos protection
